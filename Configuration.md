# Configuration standard

IoT things have different configuration properties like an identifier, a MAC address or the MQTT broker address. Some of them are writable, others are read-only. This specification aims to standardize their names and possible values.

## General

### Type

The type of each property is defined in regard to the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) standard and its seven [data types](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#name-type) which are `array`, `boolean`, `integer`, `object`, `null`, `number` or `string`.

### Existence

Properties might be optional. If they are not set and thus not present in a configration object, it means that the thing does not support the corresponding feature. For example, the property `bluetooth` might be missing in a [thing object](#thing), which would mean, that this specific thing does not support bluetooth.

If the thing supports a features but its value is not set, the corresponding configuration property must be present and its value must be `null`. For example, a thing supports WiFi but its SSID is not set yet. The [thing configuration object](#thing) must contain the `wifi` property which must have a present [WiFi configuration object](#wifi) set as its value. The WiFi configuration object must contain an `ssid` configuration property which must have `null` as its value, as long as the SSID is not set. It must be present though, because the thing supports setting an SSID for its WiFi hardware interface.

## Configuration objects

### Thing

The configuration properties of a thing. The contained primitive typed properties serve the purpose of end user properties which can be used to further identify the thing.
